# TODO

1.  Use Bandit github action on my mkdocs plugin source code to see how the
    results work.
1.  Add reporting to show code is reading from or writing to any file in the
    system.
1.  Use github copilot and ask question to fetch all the URLs that are
    executable.
1.  Need to implement for JS?
1.  Adding tree-sitter shared objects to the package for now. Try to install
    shared objects based on filetypes detected by domain-catcher. Look at
    nvim-treesitter to see how they do it.
